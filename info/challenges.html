                            <p> While green energy has a high efficiency vs energy input, the energy yield it produces
                                is quite low. <br>
                                The energy sources which are used to power bio homes, such as solar panels, can be quite
                                expensive. <br>
                                Renewable energy sources tend to be vulnerable depending on the location of the energy

                                <div>It can be difficult to sell your bio homes once you buy them. This is because most
                                    realtors and buyers are not aware about green home products and the construction
                                    involved. </div>

                                <div> As most bio homes have a high demand for solar energy, it raises the need for them
                                    to be placed in specific locations that can provide the most sunlight. This moves
                                    these bio homes away from regular places to more isolated places.</div>
                                <div> Materials can be hard to find to build the bio homes, especially in most urban
                                    areas which are not very bio-friendly areas (Urban areas constitute the majority of

                                <div> Most bio homes lack an air-cooling system, because they mostly run on heat sources
                                    and are not designed for hot areas because they do not have any air ventilation

                            <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a governmental agency which seeks to protect
                                the health of humans and the environment.<br>
                                It acomplishes its goals by developing and enforcing rules and regulations for companies
                                and states, and other entities. <br>
                                When planning a Bio Home, be sure to follow regulations posted by the EPA. Failing to do
                                so will result in the denial of a request to build a bio home.

                                <p> If you are currently interested in buying solar for your current home you might need
                                    to look at what
                                    a Solar Power Purchase Agreement is. A Solar Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) is an
                                    agreement in which a third party operates the
                                    system and the customer hosts the system's electric output. You simply supply the
                                    property in which the solar panels are located. <br>

                                    <li>More complex negotiations and potentially higher transaction costs than buying
                                        PV system outright. <br></li>
                                    <li>Administrative cost of paying two separate electricity bills if system does not
                                        meet 100 percent of the site's electric load.<br> </li>
                                    <li>Potential increase in property taxes if property value is reassessed.<br></li>
                                    <li>Site lease may limit ability to make changes to property that would affect PV
                                        system performance or access to the system.<br></li>

                <h4> What are Zoning Laws for? </h4>
                <p>The purpose of zoning laws is to regulate impacts that may not be in the best interests of the people
                    including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protecting value of properties by separating incompatible land uses.</li>

                    </ul>
                    Zoning laws are often flexible since future plans are not always deterministic.

                Zoning laws are region specific. Make sure to research the county's or city's zoning laws to ensure you
                do not violate any laws. <br>
                Typically, certain renewable energy types are not specified in a county's or city's zoning laws, but are
                often still allowed in that county or city. <br>
                Installation still holds many problems if there are not any specific rules about renewable energy. <br>
                Neighbors or other residents could sue you for the
                installation of a solar panel for aa variety of reasons so make sure to properly review the local area's zoning laws.

                    <h4> Renewable Energy Licensing/Certification</h4>
                    For renewable energy, most states do not require licensing or certification,
                    but licensing or certification is needed to be eligible for financial benefits. </br>
                    The website <a
                        href="https://www.solarenergy.org/state-licensing-requirements/">https://www.solarenergy.org/state-licensing-requirements/</a>
                    shows requirements for industry professionals. Make sure you understand these licenses and
                    certifications and ensure your professional is using these standards. <br>
                    If your area has an HOA, the
                    HOA will investigate the professional that is
                    installing your system and will notify you if they are following the HOA rules and regulations.
